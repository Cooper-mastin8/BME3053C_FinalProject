Steps to run Code
1. Ensure proper libraries are installed, including pandas, umap-learn, sklearn, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

2. Load in the dataset using its designated path.

3. Run the data processing to filter out insignifcant data points such as unrelated questions and missing values. Only keep data points that include current alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, cigarette, and fast food use. Run the code to identify the region of each data point along with age and sex.

4. Choose dimensionality and the amount of clusters for the umap and kmean analysis. Run this section of the code to identify clusters.

5. Choose target variable for decision tree analysis. In the code's current state, fast food consumption is targeted in ranges of low, medium, and high levels of consumption based on the percentage of a data point consuming it.
